### The name is inspired by the movie "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang". I personally never saw the movie, but the title sounded fun. This project is to create a chat room where I can chat with my friends without my FBI agent, Frank, judging my life and my life choices. The goal is to help others escape their own personal FBI agents, or NSA agents, or whatever agents they might have for just a moment. You, too, can now talk about that time where you decided that a horseraddish, and sauerkraut mixed into a strawberry cheesecake ice cream was a good idea. I'm not trying to yuck your yum, but that's gross. 


## What I used
Python, Django, HTML


## Optimization
I plan on making changes to the colors, and other things to make it look more visually pleasing
